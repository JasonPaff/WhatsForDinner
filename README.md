# Whats For Dinner

- **Purpose:** An app to connect the ingredients in your fridge to tasty recipes found online; as well as show you
  nearby restaurants that can satiate your culinary desires. We aimed to create a dynamic application that was easily accessible to people looking to cook at home. We also wanted to have an option for people that started looking at making a recipe and decided they were too short on time or ingredients so we added a dine out feature that shows local restaurants that you can sort by style of food.
